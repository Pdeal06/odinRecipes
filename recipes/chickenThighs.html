    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Chicken thighs are dark meat that is naturally more flavorful than other pieces such as the breast.
            When you add my simple spice blend before baking, 
            these are off the charts delicious. 
        </p>

        <p>The skin is perfectly crisp, while the meat is juicy and tender. 
            This recipe is versatile because it is a basic chicken recipe that
            goes well with just about any side dish. You can even increase the 
            spice for this recipe by adding a pinch of chili powder and cayenne.
