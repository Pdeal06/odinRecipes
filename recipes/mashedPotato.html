    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Chicken thighs are dark meat that is naturally more flavorful than other pieces such as the breast.
            When you add my simple spice blend before baking, 
            these are off the charts delicious. 
        </p>

        <p>The skin is perfectly crisp, while the meat is juicy and tender. 
            This recipe is versatile because it is a basic chicken recipe that
            goes well with just about any side dish. You can even increase the 
            spice for this recipe by adding a pinch of chili powder and cayenne.
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>                
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Set a wire rack 
                inside a broiler pan or baking pan.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Lift up skin gently; sprinkle salt, 
                pepper, and garlic powder under the skin. Replace skin. 
                Season skin and underside of the thighs with salt, pepper, 
                and garlic powder. Arrange on the rack.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature 
                to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Continue roasting until juices run clear, about 30 minutes more. 
                Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>    
        </ol>
